.Goals
[abstract]
This guide highlights the different options for setting up Neo4j in the cloud.
It includes setting up Neo4j on EC2 on AWS, using our Docker image, and introduces the different Neo4j cloud-hosting partners.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should know how to run and operate Neo4j locally.
Knowledge of link:/developer-resources/language-guides[remote drivers] to access Neo4j from your application helps you connect to your cloud-hosted database.
For self-service hosting you should bring along enough operations experience that a Linux system doesn't scare you away.

=== Neo4j with Docker

image:://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/neo4j-docker-image-now-in-beta-235x300.jpg[float=right]

link:http://docker.com[Docker] is a lightweight virtualization mechanism to run single applications containerized and restricted on your machine.
Docker images are pre-build in layers from configuration of services one of which would be Neo4j.
A docker image can be started immediately after downloading, no time-consuming boot required.

Neo4j and Docker provide an officially supported link:http://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j[Docker image].
Please also see the documentation for the Neo4j link:/developer-resources/integration/docker/docker-23[version 2.3] and the new link:{opsmanual}/deployment/single-instance/docker/[3.x releases].

Other projects around docker are discussed on our link:/developer-resources/integration/docker[Neo4j & Docker integration page].

=== Hosting on AWS / EC2

////
Outdated not updated for 3.0

We provide a https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/ec2neo[EC2 CloudFormation Template] that creates a single server running Neo4j.  This template creates a complete Neo4j installation, including Amazon AWS server, fixed IP address and backup storage.
It's intended to help application developers get up and running quickly with Neo4j without in-depth experience of Linux servers, AWS, or installing databases like Neo4j.

This is provided on a contrib basis: we welcome Pull Requests.  Please take extra care to make sure that you're running as many Amazon machines as you want, and not more.
////

Installing Neo4j on any Debian or Ubuntu system can be accomplished by following the instructions on link:http://debian.neo4j.org[our Debian Repository].
//  We also offer an experimental http://yum.neo4j.org[Yum repository].

For other Linux distributions, download the link:http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases[Neo4j tarball]; it can be uncompressed and run interactively.
// what is the new link?
Our operations manual discusses several ways to run link:{opsmanual}/deployment/single-instance/linux/#linux-service[Neo4j as system service on Linux].

=== Windows Azure

It gets easier to deploy Neo4j Server on Azure every day, so here you can find some step-by-step instructions and hints on how to achieve that.

Neo4j installation on Windows Azure can be provisioned through the VMDepot Image or by provisioning Linux instances and then running any of the provisioning scripts you'd like.
